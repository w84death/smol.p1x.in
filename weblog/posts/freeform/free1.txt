Free form writing #1
Just a moment of me and the text file. Im writing whatever I'm thinking at present moment.
What make the text file special for me is the same as writing by hand on paper for writers.
Text files are easy to process and share between different operating systems and architectures. ASCII is universal.

I'm not writing a big article nor book chapter. I can brake any rule, skip proof reading, formatting. All I'm doing is writing. In a zen mode, no distractions. A closest experience you can have to the real typewriter.

The key is a keyboard. A good one. That doesn't mean expensive, just not cheap. I got Microsoft Ergonomic, the one split in half and curved in. Superb keeb.
