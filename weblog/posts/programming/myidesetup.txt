My IDE Setup
I spend most of my codding time in VSCode on Linux (various distributions).
It has all the extensions I need, it is fast, and available on any modern OS. This last part is important to me as I can continue my work on any systems I use, including Windows work machines.

Extensions I use:
* Code Spell Checker
* GitHub Copilot
* Hex Editor
* Remote - SSH
* x86 and x86_64 Assembly
* C/C++
* various "Cyberpunk 2077" Themes

I got Source Control opened on left and Copilot on right. Terminal on bottom if needed.
I'm using Copilot as interactive documentation and writing comments.
