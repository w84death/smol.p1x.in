# KBD Typing Game Manual

## Overview

The Typing Game is designed to improve your typing skills by presenting you with random words that fall from the top of the screen. Your goal is to type each word correctly before it reaches the bottom. The game tracks your score and time, and includes a dark mode feature to make playing easier on the eyes.
Features

- Random Word Generation: Words fall from the top of the screen at increasing speeds.
- Scoring System: Score points based on the length of the words you type correctly. If you use backspace, the score is halved.
